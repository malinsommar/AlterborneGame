        <h3>About the game</h3>
        <p>Alterborne is an old school turn-based RPG (role-playing game). You play as a party of four: <br>
          <b>Warrior</b> – a tanky character who can buff their teammates or debuff enemies <br>
          <b>Ranger</b> – can hide in the shadows to do extra damage <br>
          <b>Mage</b> – deals great damage but has very low HP <br>
          <b>Healer</b> - deals low damage but has the ability to heal their teammates <br>
          <br>
          Every class has a different set of skills, but all classes have a basic Attack and Block, both of which cost 2 Energy. Skills usually cost more, but are very useful. <br>
          The amount of HP, Damage, and Block varies between all classes. However, these are increased as you gain more levels or find better gear. <br>
          You can gain new weapons or armor <i>(see each character's own page to see their respective gear)</i> after fights or buy them at the shop. The shop also carries potions, of which there are four different kinds: Healing potion, Block potion, Energy potion, and Strength potion. You can choose between Minor, Lesser, and Major. <br> <br>
          When you come into the Overworld you have the opportunity to choose where you want to go. All fight entrances have recommended skill levels written above them, but you can enter any of them as you will. All fights have a common enemy you will run into most often, but there is also a chance to meet the level's boss. The bosses are very strong opponents, but give useful and powerful loot if beaten. <br> <br>
          In the Overworld you will also find the Shop where you can always fill up on potions or buy new gear. <br> <br>
          If you're lucky – or unlucky – you might find a secret battle. <br> <br>
          Play and see if you can save the world!
