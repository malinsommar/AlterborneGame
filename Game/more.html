        <h3>Functional programming</h3>
        <p>The imperative programming style is a sort of list for the program to follow. When a code is made, it's required that the code will
          be read from the top down. Otherwise the thing won't work.<br><br>
          
          Functional programming is a declarative type of programming. Meaning it's more freeflowing than the imperative style.
          The main defining difference between the two styles is how the imperative style is about "<i>how</i> to solve" while the declarative
          is about "<i>what</i> to solve". <br>
          In the case of functional programming it uses expressions instead of statement. An expression produces value,
          while a statement assigns a variable. <br><br>
          
          The fundamental concepts within Functional programming are: <br>
         <b> Pure Functions <br>
          Recursion <br>
          Referential Transparency <br>
          Functions are First-Class and can be Higher-Order <br>
          Variables are immutable</b>
          
          <br><br>
          The most basic part of functional programming is the <b>pure function</b>. A pure function is defined by two properties. Firstly, it returns the
          same result if given the same argument. Secondly, it doesn't cause any side-effects. The latter is called "immutability", meaning it only
          affects the value it returns. <br>
          This makes functional programming easy to debug, while also making it easier to use in parallel with other extensions. Using a smart compiler,
          the program can be frozen while remembering the result of the code. Since values won't change until code has been changed, it can be set on hold
          until the value becomes necessary. <br>
          It's therefore not necessary within functional programming to have a "list" of code, since the expressions work independently.
          <br> <br>
          <b>Recursion</b> is the Functional programming's alternative to for-loops. A recursive function is instead simply called repeatedly until
          its base case is reached. <br><br>
          
          <b>Referential Transparency</b> is about how every value in essence is constant. Once a value has been declared a value, it can't be changed.
          This decreases chances of side-effects for the program.
          <br><br>
          <b>Functions are First-Class and can be Higher-Order. </b>This basically means a function can be passed into another function's parameter. They can also
          be returned from from a function and be saved into data-structures.
          <br><br>
          <b>Variables are immutable</b> means that all variables defined can't be changed. They are a constant natively. Coding can therefore be done
          without worrying about values not changing.
          <br><br>
          All of these factors make Functional programming an all-around easier to read and follow coding experience. With constant
          variables and values its easier to work around new concept without the worry of interrupting previous code.
          The big drawback of Functional programming is the possible decrease in performance when new values and variables have to be
          created. Therefore it's most likely best suited for smaller projects.
          <br><br>
          Functional programming is mainly used for "mathematical computations"/arithmetics and parallel coding.
          <br><br>
          Functional programming is based on the Lambda Calculus framework, developed by Alonzo Church, to study the use of functions
          within programming. It forms a theoretical framework for how functions work within coding, and forms a basis for almost
          all functional programming.
          One of Church's students was Alan Turing.</p>
